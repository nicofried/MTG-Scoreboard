The X in the unveiling triggered ability has the same value as the X paid in the Unveil ability. This is pretty easy to derive since there is no other source of X.
Once The Depths Caller’s unveiling triggered ability begins to resolve, no players may take other actions until it’s done. Notably, players can’t try to destroy your permanents after you’ve chosen a type.
