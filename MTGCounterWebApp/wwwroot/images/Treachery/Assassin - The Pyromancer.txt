If The Pyromancer doesn’t deal damage to a creature (perhaps because that damage was prevented), neither additional effect will apply. It won’t lose indestructible.
Creatures with indestructible that enter the battlefield after The Pyromancer’s unveiling triggered ability resolves will still have indestructible.
Once The Pyromancer’s unveiling triggered ability begins to resolve, no player may take actions until it’s done. Notably, players can’t try to give a creature indestructible again to save it from the damage.
