All The Ferryman does when it resolves is set up a delayed triggered ability. If the targeted permanent isn’t put into a graveyard this turn, that ability never triggers. If the targeted permanent is put into a graveyard this turn, that ability triggers and resolves like any other triggered ability.
The permanent card that will be returned to the battlefield isn’t chosen until the delayed triggered ability resolves. The player who chooses is the player who controlled The Ferryman.
The permanent that’s returned to the battlefield can’t be the same one that was put into the graveyard (assuming it’s still in the graveyard when the delayed triggered ability resolves).
