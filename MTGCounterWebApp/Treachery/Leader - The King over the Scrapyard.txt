A spell or ability destroys or exiles a permanent only if that spell or ability specifically contains the word "destroy" or "exile" in its text. The following wonâ€™t cause The King over the Scrapyard to trigger: If a spell or ability an opponent controls deals lethal damage to a creature you control, causes you to sacrifice a permanent, removes all loyalty counters from a planeswalker you control, or causes an ability you control to trigger (and then that ability destroys or exiles a permanent you control).
