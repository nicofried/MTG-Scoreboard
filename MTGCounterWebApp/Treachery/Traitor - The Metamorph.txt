You can’t pay the unveil cost if you have no cards in hand or if your life total is less than 8.
You may steal the Leader player’s identity card as they lose the game. If you do, the game will go on.
A Leader identity card can be turned face down. It will have no characteristics and you won’t be able to turn it face up if it doesn’t have Unveil. However, your win conditions still change according to that role. Players will be able to track a Leader identity card turned face down this way until it’s shuffled in a face-down pile or it becomes a new object. (See rule 707.6 in the official CR, the same is true for a face-down identity card.)
"Put outside the game" means to remove it from game, not exiling it. The same identity card can be put outside the game only once.
If the game is restarted and The Metamorph was put outside the game, it comes back to the new game. This is an exception to rule 108.5 in the official CR due to rule 716.2 in the official CR taking precedence. The previously stolen identity card in the restarted game will leave the game as its original owner has lost that game.
The Metamorph’s replacement effect will apply no matter how a player loses the game: due to a state-based action (as a result of having a life total of 0 or less, trying to draw a card from an empty library, or having ten poison counters), a spell or ability that says that player loses the game, a concession, or a game loss awarded by a judge.
In a multiplayer game using the limited range of influence option (such as a Grand Melee game), if a spell or ability says that you win the game, it instead causes all of your opponents within your range of influence to lose the game. This is another way by which The Metamorph’s replacement effect can apply.
Your win conditions change according to your new role.
