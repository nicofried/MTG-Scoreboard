The Corpse Snatcher features a reflexive trigger. When it’s unveiled, its triggered ability goes on the stack without a target. When that ability finished resolving, a second ability triggers and you pick a target player that will get a reanimated creature. Players may cast spells and activate abilities before they are milled and then again after they are milled but before a creature is reanimated.
The Corpse Snatcher’s reanimating triggered ability doesn’t target a creature card. You choose which card you’re putting onto the battlefield as it resolves. You can choose any creature card in a graveyard at that time, including one just put into a graveyard by The Corpse Snatcher. If there are no creature cards in graveyards at that time, The Corpse Snatcher simply finishes resolving.
