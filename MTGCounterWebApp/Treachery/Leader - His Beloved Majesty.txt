Other players decide in turn order whether or not they accept the offering (choosing a nonenchantment, nontoken permanent and drawing a card). Each player will know the decisions of previous players in turn order when making their decision.
After each other player has decided, the stealing effect happens simultaneously for each one who accepted the offering.
